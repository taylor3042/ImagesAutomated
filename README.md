# Overview

This software, the python file, is simply meant to resize, scale, and change file types if need be.

My purpose for creating this is to create an easier way to get images from the internet into an AI software.

# Development Environment

The tools I used are git, Visual Studio Code, and the Linux OS.

The programming language I used for this was Python 3.8.10
